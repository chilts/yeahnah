** *Yeah, Nah* ** is a movie recommendations site:

You can see it at [http://yeahnah.maori.geek.nz/](http://yeahnah.maori.geek.nz/)

It is implemented using:

1. [Good Enough Recommendations Engine (GER)](https://github.com/grahamjenson/ger)
2. [Hapi.js](http://hapijs.com/)
3. [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

The code is designed to be very minimal using CDNs where possible.

To run it you will need a MovieDB API key.
